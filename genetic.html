            <h2 class="section-header">Definition</h2>
            <p>Genetic diversity is the biological variation that occurs within species. It makes it possible
                for species to adapt when the environment changes.</p>
            <p>Genetic diversity is <span style="color:rgb(2, 2, 56);font-weight:bold;">the total number
                    of genetic characteristics in the genetic makeup of a species</span>, it ranges widely from the number of species to
                differences within species and <span style="color:rgb(43, 57, 17);font-weight:bold;">can be attributed to the span of
                    survival for a species</span>. It is distinguished from genetic variability, which describes the tendency of genetic
                characteristics to vary.</p>
            <p>Genetic diversity serves as a way for populations to adapt to changing environments. With more
                variation, it is more likely that some individuals in a population will possess variations of alleles that are
                suited for the environment. Those individuals are more likely to survive to produce offspring bearing that allele. The
                population will continue for more generations because of the success of these individuals.</p>
            <p>The academic field of population genetics includes several hypotheses and theories regarding
                genetic diversity. The neutral theory of evolution proposes that diversity is the result of the accumulation of
                neutral substitutions. Diversifying selection is the hypothesis that two subpopulations of a species live in
                different environments that selectfor different alleles at a particular locus. This may occur, for instance, if a species has a
                large range relative to the mobility of individuals within it. Frequency-dependent selection is the hypothesis that as
                alleles become more common, they become more vulnerable. This occurs in host–pathogen interactions, where a high
                frequency of a defensive allele among the host means that it is more likely that a pathogen will spread if it is able
                to overcome that allele.</p>
           <h2 class="section-header">Diversity</h2>
             <p>A study conducted by the National Science Foundation in 2007 found that genetic diversity
                (within-species diversity) and biodiversity are dependent upon each other — i.e. that diversity within a species is necessary
                to maintain diversity among species, and vice versa. According to the lead researcher in the study, Dr. Richard
                Lankau, "If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down, and the community becomes dominated by a
                single species."
                Genotypic and phenotypic diversity have been found in all species at the protein, DNA, and
                organismal levels; in nature, this diversity is nonrandom, heavily structured, and correlated with environmental variation
                and stress.</p>
            <p>Neutral genetic diversity consists of genes that do not increase fitness and are not
                responsible for adaptability. Natural selection does not act on these neutral genes. Adaptive genetic diversity consists of
                genes that increase fitness and are responsible for adaptability to changes in the environment. Adaptive genes are
                responsible for ecological, morphological, and behavioral traits. Natural selection acts on adaptive genes
                which allows the organisms to evolve. The rate of evolution on adaptive genes is greater than on neutral genes due to the
                influence of  selection. However, it has been difficult to identify alleles for adaptive genes and thus
                adaptive genetic diversity is most often measured indirectly.</p>
            <p>Identifying adaptive genetic diversity is important for conservation because the adaptive
                potential of a species may dictate whether it survives or becomes extinct, especially as the climate changes.</p>
            <p>Variation in the populations gene pool allows natural selection to act upon traits that allow
                the population to adapt to  changing environments. Selection for or against a trait can occur with changing environment -
                resulting in an increase  in genetic diversity (if a new mutation is selected for and maintained) or a decrease in
                genetic diversity (if a  disadvantageous allele is selected against). Hence, genetic diversity plays an important role
                in the survival and adaptability of a species. The capability of the population to adapt to the changing
                environment will depend on the presence of the necessary genetic diversity The more genetic diversity a population has, the
                more likelihood the population will be able to adapt and survive.</p>
            <p>The natural world has several ways of preserving or increasing genetic diversity. Among oceanic
                plankton, viruses aid in the genetic shifting process. Ocean viruses, which infect the plankton, carry genes of other
                organisms in addition to their own. When a virus containing the genes of one cell infects another, the genetic makeup
                of the latter changes. This constant shift of genetic makeup helps to maintain a healthy population of plankton despite
                complex and unpredictable environmental changes.</p>
            <p>Large populations are more likely to maintain genetic material and thus generally have higher
                genetic diversity. Small populations are more likely to experience the loss of diversity over time by random
                chance, which is an example of genetic drift. Cheetahs are a threatened species. Low genetic diversity and resulting poor
                sperm quality has made breeding and survivorship difficult for cheetahs. Moreover, only about 5% of cheetahs survive to adulthood.
                However, it has been recently discovered that female cheetahs can mate with more than one male per litter of cubs.
                They undergo induced ovulation, which means that a new egg is produced every time a female mates. By mating with
                multiple males, the mother increases the genetic diversity within a single litter of cubs. Efforts are underway to
                promote genetic diversity in cheetahs through captive breeding programs and habitat conservation. These programs aim to increase the number of genetically diverse individuals and
                reintroduce them into the wild, thus enhancing the overall genetic health of cheetah populations.</p>
            <p>Islands are unique ecosystems that provide an interesting perspective on the importance of
                genetic diversity in wildlife conservation. Due to their isolation, island populations often have limited gene flow with the
                mainland and can experience a reduction in genetic diversity. The loss of genetic diversity on islands can have
                severe consequences for the unique species that inhabit them. Protecting and restoring genetic diversity in island populations is crucial for their long-term
                survival. Conservation efforts often involve establishing wildlife corridors or translocating individuals between
                islands to promote gene flow and prevent further loss of genetic diversity. Additionally, habitat restoration and the removal
                of invasive species can help create more favorable conditions for the recovery of genetic diversity in island ecosystems.

            <p><strong>Marine biodiversity is the variety of life in our ocean. It includes all animals, plants
                    and microorganisms living in our ocean, from barnacles to whales to coral reefs. The term is also used to describe the
                    abundance of species living in an area.</strong></p>
            <p>The ocean is one of the main repositories of the world's biodiversity. It constitutes over 90 per
                cent of the habitable space on the planet and contains some 250,000 known species, with many more remaining to be
                discovered—at least two thirds of the world's marine species are still unidentified.</p>
           <p>The ocean, and the life therein, are critical to the healthy functioning of the planet, supplying
                half of the oxygen we breathe and absorbing annually about 26 per cent of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide emitted into
                the atmosphere. Marine environments contain some of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet, even more diverse
                than tropical rainforests. Yet they are subject to multiple stressors that can impact their sustainability and
                biodiversity. The IAEA uses nuclear and isotopic tools to study marine ecosystems and offer expertise on how to counter
                loss of biodiversity. Human activities have a major impact on marine environments. Pollutants released from industrial,
                agricultural and other such activities enter the oceans through groundwater, surface water and precipitation. Rapid
                urbanisation and infrastructure development in coastal areas encroach on natural habitats and modify the functioning
                of ecosystems, with for example changes in currents and nutrient distribution. Evidence continues to emerge demonstrating the essential role of marine biodiversity in underpinning
                a healthy planet and social well-being. The fishery and aquaculture sectors are a source of income for hundreds of
                millions of people, especially in low-income families, and contribute directly and indirectly to their food security.
                Marine ecosystems provide innumerable services for coastal communities around the world. For example, mangrove
                ecosystems are an important source of food for more than 210 million people but they also deliver a range of other services,
                such as livelihoods, clean water, forest products, and protection against erosion and extreme weather events.</p>
