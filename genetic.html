        <p>Genetic diversity is the biological variation that occurs within species. It makes it possible for species to adapt when
        the environment changes.</p>
                <p>Genetic diversity is <span style="color:rgb(2, 2, 56);font-weight:bold;">the total number of genetic characteristics in the genetic 
                makeup of a species</span>, it ranges widely from the number of species to differences within species and
                <span style="color:rgb(43, 57, 17);font-weight:bold;">can be attributed to the span of survival for a species</span>. 
                It is distinguished from genetic variability, which describes the tendency of genetic characteristics to vary.</p>
           <p>Genetic diversity serves as a way for populations to adapt to changing environments. With more variation, it is more
          likely that some individuals in a population will possess variations of alleles that are suited for the environment.
          Those individuals are more likely to survive to produce offspring bearing that allele. The population will continue for
          more generations because of the success of these individuals.</p>
          <p>The academic field of population genetics includes several hypotheses and theories regarding genetic diversity. The
          neutral theory of evolution proposes that diversity is the result of the accumulation of neutral substitutions.
          Diversifying selection is the hypothesis that two subpopulations of a species live in different environments that select
          for different alleles at a particular locus. This may occur, for instance, if a species has a large range relative to
          the mobility of individuals within it. Frequency-dependent selection is the hypothesis that as alleles become more
          common, they become more vulnerable. This occurs in host–pathogen interactions, where a high frequency of a defensive
          allele among the host means that it is more likely that a pathogen will spread if it is able to overcome that allele.</p>
        <h2 class="section-header">Diversity</h2>
          <p>A study conducted by the National Science Foundation in 2007 found that genetic diversity (within-species diversity) and
          biodiversity are dependent upon each other — i.e. that diversity within a species is necessary to maintain diversity
          among species, and vice versa. According to the lead researcher in the study, Dr. Richard Lankau, "If any one type is
          removed from the system, the cycle can break down, and the community becomes dominated by a single species."
          Genotypic and phenotypic diversity have been found in all species at the protein, DNA, and organismal levels; in nature,
          this diversity is nonrandom, heavily structured, and correlated with environmental variation and stress.</p>
          <p>Neutral genetic diversity consists of genes that do not increase fitness and are not responsible for adaptability.
          Natural selection does not act on these neutral genes. Adaptive genetic diversity consists of genes that increase
          fitness and are responsible for adaptability to changes in the environment. Adaptive genes are responsible for
          ecological, morphological, and behavioral traits. Natural selection acts on adaptive genes which allows the organisms
          to evolve. The rate of evolution on adaptive genes is greater than on neutral genes due to the influence of
          selection. However, it has been difficult to identify alleles for adaptive genes and thus adaptive genetic diversity
          is most often measured indirectly.</p>
          <p>Identifying adaptive genetic diversity is important for conservation because the adaptive potential of a species may
          dictate whether it survives or becomes extinct, especially as the climate changes.</p>
          <p>Variation in the populations gene pool allows natural selection to act upon traits that allow the population to adapt to
          changing environments. Selection for or against a trait can occur with changing environment - resulting in an increase
          in genetic diversity (if a new mutation is selected for and maintained) or a decrease in genetic diversity (if a
          disadvantageous allele is selected against). Hence, genetic diversity plays an important role in the survival and
          adaptability of a species. The capability of the population to adapt to the changing environment will depend on the
          presence of the necessary genetic diversity The more genetic diversity a population has, the more likelihood the
          population will be able to adapt and survive.</p>
          <p>The natural world has several ways of preserving or increasing genetic diversity. Among oceanic plankton, viruses aid in
          the genetic shifting process. Ocean viruses, which infect the plankton, carry genes of other organisms in addition to
          their own. When a virus containing the genes of one cell infects another, the genetic makeup of the latter changes. This
          constant shift of genetic makeup helps to maintain a healthy population of plankton despite complex and unpredictable
          environmental changes.</p>
          <p>Large populations are more likely to maintain genetic material and thus generally have higher genetic diversity.
          Small populations are more likely to experience the loss of diversity over time by random chance, which is an example of
          genetic drift. Cheetahs are a threatened species. Low genetic diversity and resulting poor sperm quality has made breeding and
          survivorship difficult for cheetahs. Moreover, only about 5% of cheetahs survive to adulthood. However, it has been
          recently discovered that female cheetahs can mate with more than one male per litter of cubs. They undergo induced
          ovulation, which means that a new egg is produced every time a female mates. By mating with multiple males, the mother
          increases the genetic diversity within a single litter of cubs. Efforts are underway to promote genetic diversity in cheetahs through captive breeding programs and habitat
        conservation. These programs aim to increase the number of genetically diverse individuals and reintroduce them into the
        wild, thus enhancing the overall genetic health of cheetah populations.</p>
          <p>Islands are unique ecosystems that provide an interesting perspective on the importance of genetic diversity in wildlife
        conservation. Due to their isolation, island populations often have limited gene flow with the mainland and can
        experience a reduction in genetic diversity. The loss of genetic diversity on islands can have severe consequences for the unique species that inhabit them.
        Protecting and restoring genetic diversity in island populations is crucial for their long-term survival. Conservation
       efforts often involve establishing wildlife corridors or translocating individuals between islands to promote gene flow
       and prevent further loss of genetic diversity. Additionally, habitat restoration and the removal of invasive species can
      help create more favorable conditions for the recovery of genetic diversity in island ecosystems.</p>
      <p><strong>Marine biodiversity is the variety of life in our ocean. It includes all animals, plants and microorganisms living in
    our ocean, from barnacles to whales to coral reefs. The term is also used to describe the abundance of species living in
    an area.</strong></p>
      <p>The ocean is one of the main repositories of the world's biodiversity. It constitutes over 90 per cent of the habitable
    space on the planet and contains some 250,000 known species, with many more remaining to be discovered—at least two
    thirds of the world's marine species are still unidentified.</p>
      <p>The ocean, and the life therein, are critical to the healthy functioning of the planet, supplying half of the oxygen we
    breathe and absorbing annually about 26 per cent of the anthropogenic carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere.
     Marine environments contain some of the most diverse ecosystems on the planet, even more diverse than tropical
      rainforests. Yet they are subject to multiple stressors that can impact their sustainability and biodiversity. The IAEA
      uses nuclear and isotopic tools to study marine ecosystems and offer expertise on how to counter loss of biodiversity.
      Human activities have a major impact on marine environments. Pollutants released from industrial, agricultural and other
      such activities enter the oceans through groundwater, surface water and precipitation. Rapid urbanisation and
     infrastructure development in coastal areas encroach on natural habitats and modify the functioning of ecosystems, with
     for example changes in currents and nutrient distribution.
    Evidence continues to emerge demonstrating the essential role of marine biodiversity in underpinning a healthy planet
    and social well-being. The fishery and aquaculture sectors are a source of income for hundreds of millions of people,
    especially in low-income families, and contribute directly and indirectly to their food security. Marine ecosystems
    provide innumerable services for coastal communities around the world. For example, mangrove ecosystems are an important
    source of food for more than 210 million people but they also deliver a range of other services, such as livelihoods,
    clean water, forest products, and protection against erosion and extreme weather events.</p></div>
